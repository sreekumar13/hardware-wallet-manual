# Initializing your Skywallet

On successfully ensuring the genuineness of your Skywallet, you can begin with the initialization of it.

## Step 1 :

The first step in initializing your Skywallet is to install the Skycoin Desktop Wallet.

As the Skycoin Desktop Wallet is used for the interaction between the Skywallet and the User.

<If you are a Windows or MAC user then>

Please make sure to download the latest compatible version from the Skycoin [Downloads](https://www.skycoin.net/downloads/) Page.

The portable and mobile version of the wallet is **not** compatible with the Skywallet.

<If you are a Linux user then please make sure to run this script>

## Step 2:

Connect your Skywallet to the USB port.

## Step 3:

Once you have connected the Skywallet to the USB port, open the Skycoin Desktop Wallet.

The instructions for a desktop wallet which is used for the first time and an already configured desktop wallet are different.

### Step 3.1: First Time Use of a Desktop Wallet

If it is for the first time you are using the desktop wallet then you will see the following screen :

In this window you can select two options :

**Configure automatically**

**Restore backup**

### Step 4.1: Configure automatically

If you are using a Skywallet for the **first** time, then you can proceed with the option of Configure Automatically.

Once the configuration is complete, the following window will be displayed.
